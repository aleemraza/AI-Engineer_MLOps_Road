# AI Engineer & MLOps Roadmap 

This repository contains hands-on projects and experiments completed as part of my journey toward becoming a Machine Learning / MLOps Engineer.

Each folder represents a standalone project focusing on a specific concept such as model training, API deployment, Dockerization, monitoring, and scalability.



## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 SimpleDockerApp
FastAPI-based image upload service with validation and local storage.

**Tech:** FastAPI, Python

### 🔹 ML_Model_Deployment
End-to-end machine learning deployment pipeline:
- Train a machine learning model
- Serve it using FastAPI
- Add logging and latency monitoring
- Dockerize the application for production-ready deployment

**Tech:** Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Docker


##  Goal

To build production-grade ML systems and demonstrate real-world MLOps practices through hands-on projects.
